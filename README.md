# Hello-world
An example to understand the different functions of Github

Hello, my name is Israel Oluwasakin and I am trying to use github for one of my mechatronicas classes. We hope to be creating a smart watch at the end of this quarter so we will see how it goes. Hopefully, I get a hang of this really quickly.
